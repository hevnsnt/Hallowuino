Easily animate electronic props that are commonly found at Target, Walmart, HomeDepot and Dollar Stores. This controller utilizes the "Try Me" interface found on most electronic halloween props, although it can control anything with a button or switch. Additionally the device has inputs for Motion Sensors, footpads, or other trigger input, including online interfaces like IFTTT and IoT protocols such as MQTT.

<h2 align="center">Features</h2>

  * Arduino Shield Formfactor (plugs in directly to UNO sized Arduinos)
  * Controls the timing for 8 Electronic props, through the "test" or "try me" button interface
  * Currently supports 2 Motion Sensors and 2 "Trigger" type inputs. (Like footpads, buttons, etc)
  * Fully configurable via a easy to use web interface
  * Future IFTTT support
  * Future MQTT support
  
<h2 align="center">How does it work?</h1>
The Hallowuino Controller can be triggered by a motion sensor, footpads, laser triggers, or even by network commands like IFTTT or MQTT and then simulates a "Button Click" to your favorite electonic prop. Although it works best with devices that have a "Try Me" button it is not limited to only those devices, if you have a prop or device that has a button, the Hallowuino can control it. This project is in active development, and soon will open an Indigogo campaign for puchase/funding options. For now it is in the development phase and none of this code should be used. <br/><br/>


*WARNING* The Hallowuino does NOT use Solid State High Voltage relays.  It is intended for battery operated props and not for high voltage devices. This is not the same as PicoBoo or BooBox Controllers.
